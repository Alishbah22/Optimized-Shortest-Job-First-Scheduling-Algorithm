# Optimized-Shortest-Job-First-Scheduling-Algorithm
This project implements an optimized preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling algorithm to improve CPU efficiency by reducing context switching, waiting time, and turnaround time, outperforming traditional algorithms like Round Robin and preemptive SJF.
